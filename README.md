Here’s an example of a **README.md** file for the Password Complexity Checker project:

# Password Complexity Checker

This Python tool evaluates the strength of a password based on specific criteria and provides feedback to users on how to improve their passwords. It’s designed to help users create stronger, more secure passwords.

---

## Features

- Checks if a password meets the following criteria:
  - Minimum length of 8 characters
  - Contains at least one uppercase letter
  - Contains at least one lowercase letter
  - Contains at least one number
  - Contains at least one special character (e.g., `!@#$%^&*`)
- Categorizes passwords as:
  - **Strong**
  - **Moderate**
  - **Weak**
- Provides actionable feedback to improve weak passwords.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher

---

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/password-complexity-checker.git
   cd password-complexity-checker
   ```

2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python password_checker.py
   ```

3. Enter a password when prompted, and the tool will display:
   - The password strength
   - Suggestions for improvement, if applicable.

---

## Example Output

```text
Enter your password: MyPassword123
Password Strength: Moderate
Suggestions:
- Include at least one special character (!@#$%^&*(),.?":{}|<>).
```

---

## How It Works

1. The script uses Python’s `re` library to evaluate the password against a set of criteria.
2. Each criterion contributes to the password's overall strength rating.
3. If the password is not strong, the tool provides targeted feedback for improvement.
